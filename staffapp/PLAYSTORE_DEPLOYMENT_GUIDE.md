## 🛠️ Step 1: Generate Release Keystore

Google Play requires all release App Bundles to be signed with a private upload key.

### Option A: Using the Automated Script (PowerShell / Windows)
From your terminal in the `staffapp` folder, run:

**In PowerShell:**
```powershell
cd staffapp
.\generate_keystore.ps1
```
*(Or if you prefer the batch file in PowerShell, run `.\generate_keystore.bat`)*

**In Command Prompt (cmd.exe):**
```cmd
cd staffapp
generate_keystore.bat
```
*(The script automatically locates your Java JDK and `keytool.exe` on Windows, prompts for a password, and creates both `android/upload-keystore.jks` and `android/key.properties`)*

### Option B: Manual Keystore Generation
Run this command from inside the `staffapp/android/` directory:
```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore upload-keystore.jks -alias greengroo_staff -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```
Then create `staffapp/android/key.properties` with:
```properties
storePassword=YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
keyAlias=greengroo_staff
storeFile=../upload-keystore.jks
```

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Never lose `upload-keystore.jks` or its passwords! Back it up securely. Google Play will not accept updates if the upload key does not match.

## 📦 Step 2: Build the Production App Bundle (`.aab`)

Google Play Console requires the **Android App Bundle (`.aab`)** format for all new app submissions.

### Option A: Using the Automated Build Script
**In PowerShell:**
```powershell
cd staffapp
.\build_appbundle.ps1
```
*(Or `.\build_appbundle.bat`)*

**In Command Prompt (cmd.exe):**
```cmd
cd staffapp
build_appbundle.bat
```

### Option B: Using Flutter CLI Directly
```bash
cd staffapp
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build appbundle --release
```

Once the build finishes, your bundle will be located at:
```
staffapp/build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```
